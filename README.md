# Firebase Todo App
Why? Why in the world would you make a todo app? Basic!ü•± Boring!üòê Uninspired!üò∂ Okay, these things are all true. But still...

Ever since working with my team at The Collab Lab on a Firebase project with a Firestore database, I've been dying to start my own Firebase project. But I put it on hold until I finished my full-stack program at Springboard. So, now that that's done! I'm free to explore all the things that were on hold.

So I started with this basic, boring, uninspired mini-project just to see if I could learn how to get things up and running with Firebase. Delighted to find it was super easy! I've only scratched the surface and there's tons more to learn, but I absolutely love how flexible, fast, and responsive Firestore is (of course I knew this from my TCL project, but just was reminded again), and how quick and easy setting up Firebase hosting is, compared to the cumbersome (not to mention $$) process of hosting a full-stack application on Heroku with a Postgres db. Inspired and excited to try something more complex, now that I've got the basics down!
